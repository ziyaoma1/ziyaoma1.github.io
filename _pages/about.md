Welcome to my website. Specialist in Statistics at University of Toronto, and experience with all sorts of programming languages both front-end and back-end. I love to draw in my free time, and all illustrations are hand-drawn by me! With that being said, I also have plenty of experience in digital design programs that I use for my illustrations!
